      "  Mr. GRASSLEY. Remember what I said, and I just said this. So you \n",
      "obviously heard me. We warned, in 2013, when I think all Republicans \n",

      "  I was struck by another thing you said, which is that the filibuster \n",
      "is not a relic of Jim Crow. I was struck about that because from 1891 \n",
      "through 1965--so we are talking over 80 years--the only thing that was \n",

      "place, or putting it where parking is virtually impossible so it is \n",
      "much harder to get to the poll, or putting out false information about \n",
      "the date and the location of the voting.\n",

      "this long enough. Let&#x27;s do four more amendments and then go to final \n",
      "passage, and there is a unanimous consent agreement to do that. We \n",
      "still do that quite often.\n",
      "  The third is to have a vote on closing debate, and we have to get 60 \n",
      "votes. It is not a ratio of those who show up to vote. So the irony is, \n",

      "the debate, and a UC would be a UC. All four tools would still be \n",
      "there, but we would be addressing final passage.\n",
      "  The problem we have--a little kind of behind-the-scenes complexity of \n",

      "amendment. So you can&#x27;t actually get to final passage unless you have a \n",

      "  But let&#x27;s talk about bipartisanship. I had hoped--we had hoped--that \n",
      "action to preserve our democracy would be a bipartisan endeavor. But \n",
      "that isn&#x27;t where we are today, and that is not new. The battle to \n",
      "protect constitutional rights has been waged along party lines in the \n",
      "past. The Fourteenth Amendment, which guaranteed citizenship to former \n",
      "slaves and guarantees equal protection under the law, was passed by \n",
      "Republicans in Congress with almost no bipartisan support. We salute \n",
      "them for that action. The 15th Amendment guarantees the right to vote \n",
      "to all citizens of the United States, and it was passed by one party \n",
      "and one party alone. Those actions were taken by the old Republican \n",
      "Party that used to be the party of Lincoln. Should we have sacrificed \n",
      "those critical amendments at the altar of bipartisanship? Should we \n",
      "have said to them: Don&#x27;t pass them because no Democrats at that time \n",
      "supported them? Of course not.\n",

      "  Another argument often made, including by many of our Democratic \n",
      "colleagues, in favor of keeping the current version of the Senate rules \n",
      "and the supermajority requirement, highlights the risk of giving up the \n",
      "``protection&#x27;&#x27; of the filibuster on issues that Democrats hold dear and \n",
      "where Republicans hold a different position.\n",
      "  If we eliminate the 60-vote threshold to pass policies that \n",
      "Republicans don&#x27;t like, won&#x27;t Republicans be able to use a majority \n",
      "vote to pass policies that Democrats don&#x27;t like?\n",
      "  That is true. That is the nature of democracy. That is what elections \n",

      "without requiring 60 votes for cloture to end debate; in other words, \n",

      "  Pennsylvania, like a lot of States, had a high-water mark of voting \n",
      "in 1960 in the election between John F. Kennedy and Richard M. Nixon, \n",
      "and then in 1964, the numbers were very high as well. So in 1960, about \n",

      "4 years. Some years, it would go up a little higher; other years, it \n",
      "would go back down. But we never got, in 60 years, to that level again.\n",
      "  For example, just the most recent two elections before 2020 in \n",
      "Pennsylvania--in the 2012 election, 5.74 million\n",
      "[[Page S255]]\n",
      "people voted. That was 57 percent of the voting-age population, so down \n",
      "from that high-water mark of 70 percent in 1960. Twenty-sixteen was a \n",
      "big turnout in our State.\n",
      "  The year 2016 was a big turnout in our State. We had more voters than \n",
      "2012. It was 6.1 million voters, and it went from 57 in 2012 to 61, so \n",

      "age population. That is the backdrop of 2016: big turnout but not the \n",
      "turnout level we saw in 1960 or 1964 or a few other years.\n",
      "  Then, in October of 2019--this is just an example of why the voting \n",
      "measures we are debating here are important in a positive way for \n",
      "helping people to vote. In October 2019, Governor Tom Wolf, in \n",
      "Pennsylvania, signed Act 77. This was a historic and comprehensive \n",
      "election reform bill that sailed through the general assembly with \n",
      "strong bipartisan support.\n",
      "  Consider this: 133 Republicans voted for this bill, when you add up \n",
      "the number who voted in the State senate for this bill who were \n",
      "Republicans and then you add them to the number in the State house who \n",
      "were Republicans who voted for the bill. When you look at it across the \n",
      "whole general assembly--both parties, both houses--about 70 percent of \n",
      "the general assembly voted for it. So there is a lot of give-and-take \n",
      "and a lot of compromise, and they voted on a strong election reform \n",
      "bill.\n",
      "  Remember, that was October of 2019, well before the onset of the \n",
      "pandemic. But thank goodness we had that bill in place during the \n",
      "pandemic. In addition to enhancing election security, the Pennsylvania \n",
      "law, so-called Act 77, established ``no excuse&#x27;&#x27; absentee voting, \n",
      "better known today as mail-in voting. That applied to all voters. \n",
      "Finally, we had a mechanism that people could vote by mail, especially \n",
      "in a pandemic.\n",

      "turnout is going to be low; and we will see what happens. Well, it \n",
      "didn&#x27;t happen that way.\n",
      "  In Pennsylvania, in 2020, 6.9 million people voted--6.9 million \n",
      "people. That is an increase of roughly 800,000 votes from just 4 years \n",
      "earlier, and that was a pretty good turnout, a really good turnout in \n",
      "2016. That 6.9 million votes amounted to 71 percent of the voting-age \n",
      "population of Pennsylvania, which was a point higher than 1960. No \n",
      "one--no one--thought that was possible. The only way it was possible \n",
      "was because we had better voting procedures in place.\n",

      "from the most recent election before 2016--2012, the 2012 election--the \n",
      "2020 election from the 2012 was a 20-percent increase in voter turnout. \n",
      "So there can&#x27;t be any dispute that Pennsylvania&#x27;s record-setting 71-\n",
      "percent turnout was made possible only through expanding opportunities \n",
      "to vote for all voters--all voters young and old and so many others in \n",
      "between. Mail-in voting enabled almost 3 million Pennsylvanians to \n",
      "safely and securely cast their ballot.\n",
      "  By any measure, Pennsylvania should be celebrated as a success story \n",
      "of why these voting provisions help people vote. I hope that we never \n",
      "fall below that 71 percent of the voting-age population. That ought to \n",
      "be the standard for voting in a pandemic or not. In fact, that number \n",
      "should go higher when we are outside of the pandemic because people \n",

      "another trick--and you didn&#x27;t know where it was. You went by the \n",
      "polling place, but you saw a long line, and you knew you didn&#x27;t have 3 \n",
      "hours to stand in that line.\n",
      "  So the Republicans in my State said: You know what, we will have an \n",
      "advantage if we get all the Republicans--or as many as we can--to ask \n",
      "for absentee ballots. And so they did. Then the Democrats said: That is \n",
      "pretty smart. We will do the same thing.\n",
      "  So the first year I was running for the State house of \n",
      "representatives, 50 percent of the people in the State were voting by \n",
      "mail by getting on a list to ask for an absentee ballot.\n",
      "  So everyone said: This is such a good idea; why don&#x27;t we do this for \n",
      "everybody and not make people request absentee ballots. So in the next \n",
      "election, which was the 2020 election, essentially, it was all vote-by-\n",

      "  And I would say: Well, that is a city issue, but I am running for the \n",
      "State legislature. But maybe the State can help get more money to the \n",
      "municipality. But what do you like?\n",
      "  Oh, we love voting by mail because we can sit at the kitchen table \n",
      "and talk over the issues. We are not trying to make decisions in the \n",
      "heat of the moment in a voting booth.\n",
      "  We have complicated ballot measures in my State.\n",
      "  We can read through the pros and cons. And--you know what--we can \n",
      "invite our children to the kitchen table and discuss it with them.\n",
      "  They really loved vote-by-mail, and we went to that system. But it \n",
      "wasn&#x27;t something driven by Ds or Rs. In fact, Republicans controlled \n",
      "the house and senate of the legislature in the State of Oregon at that \n",
      "time. They controlled both chambers.\n",
      "  Utah went to vote-by-mail. Utah is a reliably Republican State. \n",

      "that the franchise is available for every single American and that \n",
      "there are no shenanigans on election day. And shouldn&#x27;t that be what we \n",

      "is the case, but these strategies often target predominantly precincts \n",
      "that are high minority populations: Hispanic or Black precincts.\n",
      "  And other strategies target the young and college students. Why? \n",

      "passed it. All Republicans came over here, and a number of Senators \n",
      "said: We are not going to give consent to get to a final vote.\n",

      "  Now, we have had a particular development over the last three decades \n",
      "in which the Senate has become more and more dysfunctional. I had the \n",

      "1976. And up in the staff Gallery, I would go up and watch each \n",
      "amendment being debated.\n",
      "  And there was no television. So Senators couldn&#x27;t see what was going \n",
      "on. Staff back in the offices couldn&#x27;t see what was going on. There was \n",
      "no cell phone. There was no fax machine. And so each Senator had a \n",
      "staff member watching the debate. And then when the vote came, you \n",
      "would rush down to those elevators that are outside that door. And when \n",
      "the Senators came up from the subway train that comes over from the \n",
      "office buildings, you would meet your Senator, and you would describe \n",
      "the debate that had happened. And if it was your particular topic area, \n",
      "you would describe what people back home were saying or what you had \n",
      "understood was the key question. And then the Senator would come in and \n",
      "vote.\n",
      "  And then, when the vote was tallied, there would be 6 or 12 Senators, \n",
      "generally clustered here, and they would all say ``Mr. President,&#x27;&#x27; \n",
      "because whomever got called on first got the next amendment. There was \n",
      "no set of amendments lined up on the Tax Reform Act of 1976, which is \n",
      "what I was staffing for Senator Hatfield.\n",
      "  I was very intrigued by the functioning of our government. So I went \n",
      "back to college and then dropped out 3 months later to come back here \n",
      "for the start of the Carter administration to watch what was going on \n",
      "in our government with a new Presidency. I waited tables. I volunteered \n",
      "for nonprofits. I went door to door for the Virginia Consumer Congress, \n",
      "working on issues related to renewable energy or energy efficiency. But \n",
      "I watched the Senate, and what I saw was a Senate that could debate \n",
      "issues in that year of 1977.\n",
      "  Then I came back here after graduate school, and I was planning to go \n",
      "overseas to work on issues of economic development in very poor \n",
      "countries--fundamental issues of healthcare, fundamental issues of \n",
      "education. But I was offered an opportunity to work on something here \n",
      "in DC as a Presidential fellow, to work on the issue of ``How do you \n",
      "decrease the threat of blowing up the world with nuclear weapons?&#x27;&#x27;\n",
      "  So I went to work for the Secretary of Defense, Caspar Weinberger, \n",
      "under President Reagan. Then I went to work for the Congressional \n",
      "Budget Office, after 2 years of working for President Reagan and Caspar \n",
      "Weinberger. The Congressional Budget Office works for Congress, and I \n",
      "did studies and did briefings here on the Hill, watching the Senate. \n",
      "And the Senate started to have troubles, but it was still pretty \n",
      "functional.\n",
      "  Nothing prepared me for arriving here as a U.S. Senator in 2009, \n",
      "January, and seeing the utter decay and dysfunction of my beloved \n",
      "Senate--your beloved Senate, the Senate once called the greatest \n",
      "deliberative body in the world.\n",
      "  So I started to have conversations with colleagues about what had \n",
      "happened, and I saw that we had cloture motions--that is a motion to \n",
      "close debate--one after the other after the other and very few \n",
      "amendments.\n",
      "  Now, on the amendment side, this is a chart that shows the decline in \n",
      "amendments from the 109th Congress to the 116th. The 116th Congress is \n",
      "the\n",
      "[[Page S265]]\n",
      "one that just ended. There is a tenfold reduction in the number of \n",
      "amendments over those 14 years--a tenfold reduction in amendments, a \n",
      "steady line downwards.\n",
      "  Well, that is one symptom of the problem, but then there was another \n",
      "piece of this problem, which was more and more motions to close debate. \n",
      "And those motions are designed to be rare. So they take--after you make \n",
      "the motion--a day plus. You have to have an intervening day, and then \n",
      "the second day after you make the motion, you can hold a vote on \n",
      "closing debate, because it is supposed to be such a rare moment, once \n",
      "or twice a year.\n",
      "  Then, if you succeed in getting the votes to close debate, it is 30 \n",
      "hours of debate. Well, that takes 2 or 3 days to get 30 hours of debate \n",
      "in and then an extra hour for any Senator who didn&#x27;t have the chance to \n",
      "speak. So there is that factor. And then, finally, you can get to the \n",
      "final vote.\n",
      "  Those cloture motions eat up entire weeks. So you come in, and, on \n",
      "Monday, you file a motion to close debate. On Wednesday, you vote on \n",
      "actually closing debate because you have to have that intervening day \n",
      "of Tuesday. Then you have 30 hours, which takes the time up of the \n",
      "normal day of Wednesday and Thursday, and maybe on Friday you get to \n",
      "vote.\n",
      "  That is what I am saying: Every cloture motion takes up a week. Well, \n",
      "the Senate is normally only here 30 to 40 weeks a year. So if you have \n",
      "30 or 40 cloture motions, you have essentially taken up all the \n",
      "Senate&#x27;s time. But the Senate has an incredibly complex, extensive \n",
      "agenda. It needs to address so many issues in healthcare and housing \n",
      "and education, good-paying jobs, the environment. How do you take on \n",
      "climate? How do you take on international trade? How do you take on \n",
      "human rights in foreign countries like China, which are conducting \n",
      "genocide? So many issues around the world, plus it has so many \n",
      "nominations that have to be addressed.\n",
      "  I am told--I haven&#x27;t double-checked this yet--that there were four \n",
      "Cabinet positions that required confirmation in the first Congress--\n",
      "four. Then you had Ambassadors, and you had judges. But you had a \n",
      "pretty small number of nominations in those positions. Now, we have \n",
      "well over a thousand positions--well over a thousand--and we have a \n",
      "nomination process in which people are nominated to have a higher rank \n",
      "in the military or advancement to certain ranks in the civil service. \n",
      "And so you have extensive lists that need to go through as well.\n",
      "  So let&#x27;s take a look at what happened with the growth of cloture \n",
      "motions. This is the history going back to 1910. We actually only had \n",
      "cloture starting in 1917. And, in 1917, you see that there were very \n",
      "few cloture motions in a decade--3 in a decade, 10 in a decade, 5 in a \n",
      "decade, 8 in a decade, 3 in a decade--less than 1 per year.\n",
      "  Well, that intervening day kind of made sense because they were less \n",
      "than one time per year. It was supposed to be a rare moment in which \n",
      "you would address the fact that some Senators were not going to let the \n",
      "Senate proceed as our Founders envisioned, which was, after hearing \n",
      "everybody, to conduct a vote.\n",
      "  Then you start to see in the 1970s a big change. I think we have a \n",
      "chart that shows it year by year. We don&#x27;t. Well, this will give you \n",
      "some sense of it. So we have--divided by 10, since these are by \n",
      "decade--we had growth in the 1980s to more than 20 per year; a growth \n",
      "in the 1990s to more than--well, an average of 35 to 36 a year. In the \n",
      "2000s, an average of 45 per year. In the 2010 decade, an average of \n",
      "over 100 per year, taking up an entire week of the Senate&#x27;s time.\n",
      "  So how did this unfold? Well, let&#x27;s think a little bit about the fact \n",
      "that that filibuster that occurred in 1891 was about blocking Black \n",
      "Americans from having power--the power to vote--because if you have the \n",
      "power to vote, you have the power to weigh in. That means you have a \n",
      "lot of power in our society. So there was a deep determination to keep \n",
      "Black Americans from voting.\n",
      "  That was the filibuster of 1891. And its failure in the Senate--\n",
      "remember, it passed by a majority in the House, and it had majority \n",
      "support in the Senate, but the filibuster was used to crush this.\n",
      "  Now, that process meant that, from 1891 through 1965, when we passed \n",
      "voting rights in this Chamber, the filibuster was used for one thing: \n",
      "crushing the political rights of Black Americans.\n",
      "  Now, someone will say: Well, that is not quite right. There was an \n",
      "episode in 1917 in which the issue wasn&#x27;t civil rights or voting \n",
      "rights. The issue was whether to arm our commercial ships against \n",
      "potential attacks by the Germans.\n",
      "  And that is partly true.\n",
      "  In March of that year, 1917, we weren&#x27;t yet in the war, World War I. \n",
      "And there was a group of Senators who said: If we arm these ships and \n",
      "they deployed depth charges against German submarines or so forth, we \n",
      "are going to be in the war, and we will not have had a declaration of \n",
      "war. We will be pulled into the war by essentially this process of \n",
      "arming ships.\n",
      "  So they spoke at length during the last week of Congress, and time \n",
      "ran out, and the bill died. And the next week, the new Congress \n",
      "started. This is back when the transition happened in March. And the \n",
      "new Congress immediately said: We can close debate with 67 votes or \n",
      "two-thirds of the Senate. Actually, it was two-thirds; we didn&#x27;t have \n",
      "100 Senators here--two-thirds of the Senate, showing up to vote and \n",
      "close debate. So that was the first time that we had a motion to close \n",
      "debate since 1805.\n",
      "  And the reason I say it is since 1805, is that our original rules had \n",
      "a motion called the previous question. And on the previous question, \n",
      "there is a little bit of uncertainty of exactly how it was used. It \n",
      "sometimes said that, basically, you got to speed things up so we can \n",
      "get to the final vote. Other times, it has been interpreted as ``No, \n",
      "the previous question means we vote; we vote on the question before \n",
      "us.&#x27;&#x27; But it was never actually used, and it wasn&#x27;t used because there \n",
      "was a social contract.\n",
      "  The Senate said: We can listen to everybody, and, then, having heard \n",
      "everybody, we can vote.\n",
      "  Fair enough. Fair deal. Square deal.\n",
      "  So in 1805, when Aaron Burr was in charge of rewriting the rule book, \n",
      "he said: We don&#x27;t use this rule. We don&#x27;t need this rule. We have a \n",
      "social contract. We listen to everybody and then have a simple majority \n",
      "vote, as our Founders designed the Senate. No need.\n",
      "  So we hadn&#x27;t had a rule that essentially enabled this body to come to \n",
      "a vote in that period from 1805 through 1917. So it is true that the \n",
      "bill was delayed for 1 week. But the new Congress immediately came in, \n",
      "created a new rule to close debate, closed debate on that bill, and \n",
      "passed a bill to arm ships. So the only real thing that was crushed in \n",
      "those years from 1891 through 1965 was voting rights for Black \n",
      "Americans because the idea that you would prevent a simple majority \n",
      "vote, as our Founders intended, was piracy.\n",
      "  Well, in 1965, we passed voting rights, and the national consensus \n",
      "was we are putting that behind us; we are putting the discrimination \n",
      "behind us; we are putting the manipulation on election day behind us. \n",
      "We are going to have a fair opportunity for everybody to vote in this \n",
      "country. So the filibuster lost some of its taint because it was no \n",
      "longer primarily an instrument to crush the political rights of Black \n",
      "Americans.\n",
      "  People started saying: You know, maybe I can use this on something \n",
      "other than civil rights or something other than voting rights.\n",
      "  By the way, it had been used almost entirely on final passage of \n",
      "bills.\n",
      "  Maybe I can use it on nominations, to prevent nominations from going \n",
      "through expeditiously. Maybe I can use it on amendments. Maybe I can \n",
      "use it on motions to proceed.\n",
      "  Let&#x27;s take a look at the issue of amendments. Prior to the sixties, \n",
      "one time, there had been a cloture motion on an amendment.\n",
      "  You know that vision that I saw in 1976 where one amendment was \n",
      "debated, and then when it was done, there were no pending amendments, \n",
      "so the next person would say: ``Wait&#x27;&#x27;--they would always say ``Mr. \n",
      "President&#x27;&#x27; because there was always a man in the Chair at that point; \n",
      "I am now glad to say ``Madam President&#x27;&#x27;--``Madam President,&#x27;&#x27; and \n",
      "whoever got heard first would put up the next amendment.\n",
      "  Well, that world started to change along the way. People started to \n",
      "obstruct not just final passage but obstruct amendments. There has been\n",
      "[[Page S266]]\n",
      "steady growth in that over time. We are now up, in the last decade, to \n",
      "about 14 times per year or 143 times in the decade.\n",
      "  Then we have the question of the motion to proceed. You would think--\n",
      "we have a legislative calendar, and that calendar has a list of bills \n",
      "eligible to consider. Someone says: I want to make a motion--normally \n",
      "the majority leader--to go to a particular item, a particular bill on \n",
      "that calendar. You would think that it would be like ``Hey, we are \n",
      "going to go to the election bill. Do I have majority support to do \n",
      "that?&#x27;&#x27; You would have a 15-minute debate and vote. You decide to go to \n",
      "that bill or not.\n",
      "  Why would you take up a lot of the Senate&#x27;s precious time debating \n",
      "whether to debate a bill? But that logic has not prevailed, so we have \n",
      "a continuous increase in the attack on the ability to get a bill to the \n",
      "floor. Well, in the sixties, about one per year; in the seventies, \n",
      "about one per year; four times per year in the eighties; more than 10 \n",
      "in the nineties--it escalates.\n",
      "  Here is the thing: To get a bill to the floor, if a group is intent \n",
      "on forcing a cloture motion, you have to have a motion, an intervening \n",
      "day, 30 hours of debate, and then you have to be able to have an \n",
      "additional hour for any Senator who wasn&#x27;t able to speak in those 30 \n",
      "hours. In other words, it takes an entire week to decide whether to \n",
      "actually debate a bill. That is absolutely insane.\n",
      "  If you want the U.S. Senate to be unable to address issues, then \n",
      "allow unlimited debate until there is a cloture motion on the motion to \n",
      "proceed. I think most Senators agree that that should go. But here is \n",
      "the problem: Whichever party is in the minority doesn&#x27;t want to make \n",
      "things easier for the majority. And this really goes to a core \n",
      "challenge of our highly tribal parties.\n",
      "  In the Senate that I first saw, the philosophies of the two parties--\n",
      "if you were doing a bell curve of each party, they overlapped. They \n",
      "overlapped a lot. There were Republicans who voted more like Democrats \n",
      "and Democrats who voted more like Republicans. There was a lot more, \n",
      "therefore, bipartisan work. Now, if you do those same two bell curves \n",
      "on how people vote, there is a chasm. If you do a bell curve where the \n",
      "Democrats are and a bell curve where the Republicans are, there is a \n",
      "deep valley, a chasm in the middle.\n",
      "  We have become more intensely tribal in ways that are absolutely \n",
      "reinforced by social media, all those commentaries on various \n",
      "Instagrams or a tweet reinforcing the idea that the other side is evil, \n",
      "that the two sides are far apart, which leads the minority in this \n",
      "Chamber to say: Since the other side is evil, we will just prevent them \n",
      "from ever getting to a bill. If 41 of us--and right now, there are 50 \n",
      "desks on this side of the aisle, and there are 50 desks on that side of \n",
      "the aisle--if 41 of us proceed to say we will not vote to close debate \n",
      "on a motion to proceed, you can never get to a bill.\n",
      "  We have had that happen multiple times this year in which my \n",

      "the protection of voting rights. What a change from 1890, when, in the \n",
      "House of Representatives, every vote cast for the bill to defend the \n",
      "right to vote in America was a Republican vote. Now, every vote against \n",
      "debating the issue has come from the Republicans. What a swap over the \n",
      "time period.\n",
      "  This, essentially, is a strategy to kill bills in the cradle before \n",
      "they are debated on this floor.\n",
      "  Both caucuses, by the way, have done this. When I speak of voting \n",
      "rights, it is now my colleagues across the aisle who are deliberately \n",
      "blocking it from being debated time and again, but on other issues and \n",
      "when the Democrats have been in the minority, we have done the same \n",

      "Instead of an intervening day and 30 hours, plus extra hours if you \n",
      "didn&#x27;t get to debate, you have 1 hour evenly divided. If one side \n",
      "yields back its time, that means in 30 minutes, we can then decide to \n",
      "get on the bill or not.\n",
      "  Thirty hours, an intervening day, or 30 minutes. That makes a lot \n",
      "more sense. We have to end this.\n",

      "  Make no mistake about it. Using Dr. King as an inspiration, Democrats \n",
      "will continue to fight on this issue until we succeed, and I believe \n",
      "history will vindicate us.\n",
      "  Mr. President, the fight over voting rights is as old as the Republic \n",
      "itself. Recently--well, let me say, when the Republic was founded, in \n",
      "many States you had to be a White male Protestant property owner to \n",
      "vote. As is obvious by who is in this Chamber, we have made progress--\n",
      "inexorable progress--in expanding that franchise.\n",
      "  History does not regard those restrictions that occurred early on as \n",
      "worthy, but we must continue the fight. We have not reached the place \n",
      "where every person can vote easily and openly and honestly. So we have \n",
      "to keep it up.\n",
      "  I have been reading the biography of Ulysses S. Grant by Ron Chernow. \n",
      "The No. 1 thing the southern segregationists wanted to take away from \n",
      "the newly freed slaves was the right to vote. Segregationists back then \n",
      "knew that if recently freed Black slaves didn&#x27;t have the right to vote \n",
      "in the South, they would have no power at all: no power over laws, over \n",
      "resources, over the future of the country. And that was the No. 1 thing \n",
      "segregationists wanted to prevent: the right of the newly freed slaves \n",
      "to vote.\n",
      "  It is why, a century later, Dr. King made a direct appeal to Congress \n",
      "for acting on voting rights: ``Give us the\n",
      "ballot,&#x27;&#x27; he said in 1957, ``and we will no longer have to worry the \n",
      "federal government about our basic rights.&#x27;&#x27; ``Give us the ballot&#x27;&#x27; and \n",
      "all other rights will follow. With the ballot, he argued, voters could \n",
      "end the worst of racial segregation. They could elect good men and good \n",
      "women to government. They could subdue the dangers of the mob and keep \n",
      "democracy alive. But the ballot had to come first. The ballot had to \n",
      "come first.\n",
      "  Dr. King might as well have been speaking to us, because across the \n",
      "United States, in 2022, ballot access is not being expanded; it is \n",
      "being repressed. And our democracy is not safe; it is under attack.\n",
      "  A year ago, a violent mob incited by the President and his Big Lie \n",
      "attacked this very building in order to reverse the results of a free \n",
      "and fair election. Last week, for the first time, the Department of \n",
      "Justice announced sedition charges against a number of the rioters who \n",
      "were here that day.\n",
      "  A year later, at least 19 States have passed 33 laws that make it \n",
      "harder for people to vote, using the Big Lie--the Big Lie, as false as \n",
      "it is--as a justification. Those States together are home to 55 million \n",
      "Americans, and new laws are certainly coming once the State \n",
      "legislatures return to session this year. And the kind of violence--the \n",
      "threats of violence--we saw on January 6 by that insurrectionist mob is \n",
      "now being threatened increasingly against countless election workers \n",
      "across the country.\n",
      "  Just this weekend, the Houston Chronicle reported that ``County \n",
      "officials in urban areas across the State [of Texas] say they&#x27;ve been \n",
      "forced to reject an unprecedented number of mail ballot applications \n",

      "  We have seen periods of regression, in terms of voting rights and \n",
      "equality and fairness to people of color. We have seen regression \n",
      "occur. And this seems to be a period of regression in what the \n",
      "legislatures are doing, and fight it we must.\n",
      "  So the Senate must act. We must step in and act. We must do \n",
      "everything to pass voting rights legislation, just as this Chamber has \n",
      "done in the past, just as the Constitution permits us to do. That is \n",
      "why we will vote this week on the Freedom to Vote Act and the John \n",
      "Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. And if Republicans choose to \n",
      "continue their filibuster of voting rights legislation, we must \n",
      "consider and vote on the rule changes that are appropriate and \n",
      "necessary to restore the Senate and make voting legislation possible.\n",
      "  As I have recounted already, these laws are urgently needed. We must \n",
      "not--we cannot--allow another period of that regression, which we have \n",
      "seen throughout American history.\n",
      "  Here is what some of the laws would do--our two laws would do:\n",
      "  They would set basic commonsense standards for all Americans for \n",
      "access to the ballot as well as restore preclearance provisions that \n",
      "were passed by this Chamber for decades on a bipartisan basis. They \n",
      "would establish clear and consistent standards for early voting across \n",
      "the country and make it easier for voters to access absentee ballots. \n",
      "They would protect election workers from unlawful intimidation. We are \n",
      "seeing so much of that now. It is disgraceful--disgraceful. They would \n",
      "end the toxic practice of partisan gerrymandering, and they would take \n",
      "new steps to fight the power of dark money corroding our elections. \n",
      "Senate Democrats repeatedly tried, over the last year, to bring \n",

      "in its earliest days, the Senate was founded on two principles. The \n",
      "first was that Senators would have ample opportunity to make their case \n",
      "to their fellow Senators and to the country. If they had the minority \n",
      "position on a particular issue, they had a chance to come here to the \n",

      "nothing in favor of moving forward on legislation, and the 41 Senators \n",

      "  In fact, the filibuster in its current form has become a partisan \n",

      "Republicans in Congress with almost no bipartisan support. We salute \n",
      "them for that action. The 15th Amendment guarantees the right to vote \n",
      "to all citizens of the United States, and it was passed by one party \n",
      "and one party alone. Those actions were taken by the old Republican \n",

      "  If we eliminate the 60-vote threshold to pass policies that \n",

      "ourselves from the majority views of the American people.\n",

      "Senate rule itself. Most folks watching this debate may be justifiably \n",
      "confused. They are watching the Senate and they are saying: It was \n",
      "about a year ago that the Senate passed the American Rescue Plan with a \n",
      "majority vote. It was a vote of 50 to 49. It was a major piece of \n",
      "legislation responding to the pandemic emergency. Not a single \n",
      "Republican Senator voted for it, but it passed. During the Trump \n",
      "administration, Senate Republicans passed a major tax giveaway to the \n",

      "  Those laws contained major policy changes, but they could not be \n",
      "blocked by a vote of a minority of 41 Senators. Why is that? It is \n",
      "because in 1974, the Senate carved out a major exception to the \n",
      "supermajority filibuster rule for legislation connected to the annual \n",
      "budget process. That carve-out--that procedure--allowed for the passage \n",
      "of the Trump tax law, for the American Rescue Plan, and earlier for the \n",
      "Affordable Care Act.\n",
      "  So, colleagues, here we are maintaining this carve-out to the \n",
      "filibuster rule that allows Donald Trump and Senate Republicans to pass \n",
      "big tax cuts by a majority party-line vote. You can&#x27;t block it with a \n",
      "vote of 41. It allows us to pass important things like the American \n",
      "Rescue Plan, using the same procedure.\n",
      "  But our rules don&#x27;t allow us to pass rules to protect our democracy. \n",
      "That is absurd. Anyone paying close attention to the rules would see \n",
      "how absurd that is in a great democracy, and it needs to change and it \n",
      "needs to change now.\n",
      "  Each day that we maintain the current undemocratic Senate rules that \n",

      "  They really loved vote-by-mail, and we went to that system. But it \n",
      "wasn&#x27;t something driven by Ds or Rs. In fact, Republicans controlled \n",
      "the house and senate of the legislature in the State of Oregon at that \n",

      "  Utah went to vote-by-mail. Utah is a reliably Republican State. \n",

      "that the franchise is available for every single American and that \n",
      "there are no shenanigans on election day. And shouldn&#x27;t that be what we \n",
      "are all about? Because if you really want to look at where voting is \n",

      "voting are very important to address that.\n",
      "  So what do we see now in some 19 States across our country? In those \n",

      "Americans. We need to be blind to race.\n",
      "  Now, folks say: Surely, there is still not a racial component in this \n",
      "effort to keep people from voting. And I would like to affirm that that \n",
      "is the case, but these strategies often target predominantly precincts \n",
      "that are high minority populations: Hispanic or Black precincts.\n",
      "  And other strategies target the young and college students. Why? \n",
      "Because they tend to vote a little bit more to the Democratic side of \n",

      "vote by mail.\n",
      "  So we have struggled. Going back to the debate of 1890, down the hall \n",
      "in the House of Representatives, the conversation was initiated by \n",
      "Henry Cabot Lodge, and Lodge put forward a voting rights bill that \n",
      "said: You know what, things are going wrong in America, and we need to \n",
      "protect the right to register, the right to vote, and the right to\n",

      "supervision on the three critical stages of registering citizens, of \n",
      "conducting the election, and of counting the ballots afterward--those \n",
      "three phases. And it passed in the House of Representatives.\n",
      "  And at that time, it was the Republican Party that backed this \n",
      "fundamental right for all Americans. You know how many Democrats voted \n",
      "for Henry Cabot Lodge&#x27;s bill? Zero. Zero. Every vote for it came from \n",
      "the Republican Party. That was the Republican Party in 1890.\n",
      "  In 1891, the bill was here in the Senate. Well, what happened in the \n",
      "Senate? Well, a group of Senators said: We don&#x27;t want the Senate to \n",
      "ever vote on this bill. So they spoke at length, refused to give \n",
      "unanimous consent to get to a final vote.\n",
      "  Now, why do we call that a filibuster? So, at our founding, the whole \n",
      "vision that our Founders laid out was that you hear everyone speak, and \n",
      "then you vote and you take the path the majority favors over the \n",
      "minority.\n",
      "  Now, they really emphasized--this is important--that you shouldn&#x27;t \n",
      "have a supermajority because they wrote the Constitution while they \n",
      "were under the Confederation Congress. The Confederation Congress had a \n",
      "supermajority. And because of that supermajority, they couldn&#x27;t get \n",
      "anything done. They couldn&#x27;t raise the money to take on Shays&#x27; \n",
      "Rebellion. The Senate was paralyzed over policymaking.\n",
      "  So the Founders said: Whatever you do, do not have a supermajority \n",
      "because it paralyzes the body, and the body ends up taking the path the \n",
      "minority prefers, who are obstructing a final vote, rather than the \n",
      "majority.\n",
      "  Let&#x27;s just look at some of the comments that our Founders made. James \n",
      "Madison:\n",
      "       In cases where justice or the general good might require \n",
      "     new laws . . . or [new] measures . . . the . . . principle of \n",
      "     free government would be reversed.\n",
      "  He is speaking to a supermajority because it would no longer be the \n",
      "majority that would decide; it would be transferred to the minority. \n",
      "And he went on to say the damage that would be done if that happened: \n",
      "The basic principle of free government would be assaulted if the \n",
      "minority makes the decision instead of the majority.\n",
      "  What possible logic could there be to say the path that most people \n",
      "think is the wrong path is the path we will take? That is what happens \n",
      "when the supermajority blocks a final simple majority vote.\n",
      "  And we have Hamilton. Of course, Hamilton gets a lot of attention \n",
      "with the play done on Hamilton and his general supersized role in the \n",
      "early stage of our Republic.\n",
      "  Again, Hamilton was very aware of how the Confederation Congress was \n",
      "polarized before we got our Constitution in 1787. He, again, refers to \n",
      "the supermajority: It would be, in practice, as if you need everybody; \n",
      "and the history of any establishment that takes this principle is the \n",
      "result of impotence, perplexity, and disorder. He is referring to the \n",
      "supermajority requirement of the Confederation Congress.\n",
      "  What else did he say? Well, Hamilton said--and he uses some language \n",
      "we don&#x27;t really use today: ``If a pertinacious minority can control the \n",
      "majority . . . tedious delays; continual negotiation and intrigue; \n",
      "contemptible compromises of the public good.&#x27;&#x27;\n",
      "  I sometimes think that sounds like a description of the Senate \n",
      "today--tedious delays, intrigue, contemptible compromises of the public \n",
      "good. The public good is compromised when the Senate is not able to \n",
      "debate issues that face the United States of America.\n",
      "  He went on to say: ``The supermajority&#x27;s real operation is to \n",
      "embarrass the administration, to destroy the energy of the \n",
      "government.&#x27;&#x27;\n",
      "  ``Destroy the energy of the government&#x27;&#x27;? Doesn&#x27;t that ring somewhat \n",
      "true of what we have gone through in trying to get to a vote on Build \n",
      "Back Better over this last year, any components of it, and trying to \n",
      "get a vote to protect our fundamental right and freedom to vote? And it \n",
      "has gone on all year. We are a year into the administration now.\n",
      "  So in modern times, we now are facing, again, what was faced in 1890. \n",
      "And I didn&#x27;t really tell you the outcome of that 1890 debate. The House \n",
      "passed it. All Republicans came over here, and a number of Senators \n",
      "said: We are not going to give consent to get to a final vote.\n",
      "  They broke the contract--the social contract that you listen to \n",
      "everybody, and then, having heard all the ideas, having had a debate \n",
      "that maybe stretched many, many days or maybe weeks, you vote.\n",
      "  So the newspapers started to call this tactic, way back in the mid-\n",
      "1800s--they called this tactic--``piracy,&#x27;&#x27; because the core principle \n",
      "was being violated by people taking over the Senate--pirates taking \n",
      "over the Senate. And the common term for pirates, ``freebooters&#x27;&#x27;--\n",
      "freebooters, that is where ``filibuster&#x27;&#x27; comes from. It is a \n",
      "corruption of the term ``freebooter.&#x27;&#x27;\n",
      "  The pirates are taking over. They are breaking the deal of America. \n",
      "They are breaking the design of the Senate. It is supposed to be that \n",
      "after you listen to everyone--everyone has made their points--you vote \n",
      "by simple majority.\n",
      "  Now, we have had a particular development over the last three decades \n",
      "in which the Senate has become more and more dysfunctional. I had the \n",
      "chance to see this evolve because I first came here as an intern in \n",
      "1976. And up in the staff Gallery, I would go up and watch each \n",
      "amendment being debated.\n",
      "  And there was no television. So Senators couldn&#x27;t see what was going \n",
      "on. Staff back in the offices couldn&#x27;t see what was going on. There was \n",
      "no cell phone. There was no fax machine. And so each Senator had a \n",
      "staff member watching the debate. And then when the vote came, you \n",
      "would rush down to those elevators that are outside that door. And when \n",
      "the Senators came up from the subway train that comes over from the \n",
      "office buildings, you would meet your Senator, and you would describe \n",
      "the debate that had happened. And if it was your particular topic area, \n",
      "you would describe what people back home were saying or what you had \n",
      "understood was the key question. And then the Senator would come in and \n",
      "vote.\n",
      "  And then, when the vote was tallied, there would be 6 or 12 Senators, \n",
      "generally clustered here, and they would all say ``Mr. President,&#x27;&#x27; \n",
      "because whomever got called on first got the next amendment. There was \n",
      "no set of amendments lined up on the Tax Reform Act of 1976, which is \n",
      "what I was staffing for Senator Hatfield.\n",
      "  I was very intrigued by the functioning of our government. So I went \n",
      "back to college and then dropped out 3 months later to come back here \n",
      "for the start of the Carter administration to watch what was going on \n",
      "in our government with a new Presidency. I waited tables. I volunteered \n",
      "for nonprofits. I went door to door for the Virginia Consumer Congress, \n",
      "working on issues related to renewable energy or energy efficiency. But \n",
      "I watched the Senate, and what I saw was a Senate that could debate \n",
      "issues in that year of 1977.\n",
      "  Then I came back here after graduate school, and I was planning to go \n",
      "overseas to work on issues of economic development in very poor \n",
      "countries--fundamental issues of healthcare, fundamental issues of \n",
      "education. But I was offered an opportunity to work on something here \n",
      "in DC as a Presidential fellow, to work on the issue of ``How do you \n",
      "decrease the threat of blowing up the world with nuclear weapons?&#x27;&#x27;\n",
      "  So I went to work for the Secretary of Defense, Caspar Weinberger, \n",
      "under President Reagan. Then I went to work for the Congressional \n",
      "Budget Office, after 2 years of working for President Reagan and Caspar \n",
      "Weinberger. The Congressional Budget Office works for Congress, and I \n",
      "did studies and did briefings here on the Hill, watching the Senate. \n",
      "And the Senate started to have troubles, but it was still pretty \n",
      "functional.\n",
      "  Nothing prepared me for arriving here as a U.S. Senator in 2009, \n",
      "January, and seeing the utter decay and dysfunction of my beloved \n",
      "Senate--your beloved Senate, the Senate once called the greatest \n",
      "deliberative body in the world.\n",
      "  So I started to have conversations with colleagues about what had \n",
      "happened, and I saw that we had cloture motions--that is a motion to \n",
      "close debate--one after the other after the other and very few \n",
      "amendments.\n",
      "  Now, on the amendment side, this is a chart that shows the decline in \n",
      "amendments from the 109th Congress to the 116th. The 116th Congress is \n",
      "the\n",
      "one that just ended. There is a tenfold reduction in the number of \n",
      "amendments over those 14 years--a tenfold reduction in amendments, a \n",
      "steady line downwards.\n",
      "  Well, that is one symptom of the problem, but then there was another \n",
      "piece of this problem, which was more and more motions to close debate. \n",
      "And those motions are designed to be rare. So they take--after you make \n",
      "the motion--a day plus. You have to have an intervening day, and then \n",
      "the second day after you make the motion, you can hold a vote on \n",
      "closing debate, because it is supposed to be such a rare moment, once \n",
      "or twice a year.\n",
      "  Then, if you succeed in getting the votes to close debate, it is 30 \n",
      "hours of debate. Well, that takes 2 or 3 days to get 30 hours of debate \n",
      "in and then an extra hour for any Senator who didn&#x27;t have the chance to \n",
      "speak. So there is that factor. And then, finally, you can get to the \n",
      "final vote.\n",
      "  Those cloture motions eat up entire weeks. So you come in, and, on \n",
      "Monday, you file a motion to close debate. On Wednesday, you vote on \n",
      "actually closing debate because you have to have that intervening day \n",
      "of Tuesday. Then you have 30 hours, which takes the time up of the \n",
      "normal day of Wednesday and Thursday, and maybe on Friday you get to \n",
      "vote.\n",
      "  That is what I am saying: Every cloture motion takes up a week. Well, \n",
      "the Senate is normally only here 30 to 40 weeks a year. So if you have \n",
      "30 or 40 cloture motions, you have essentially taken up all the \n",
      "Senate&#x27;s time. But the Senate has an incredibly complex, extensive \n",
      "agenda. It needs to address so many issues in healthcare and housing \n",
      "and education, good-paying jobs, the environment. How do you take on \n",
      "climate? How do you take on international trade? How do you take on \n",
      "human rights in foreign countries like China, which are conducting \n",
      "genocide? So many issues around the world, plus it has so many \n",
      "nominations that have to be addressed.\n",
      "  I am told--I haven&#x27;t double-checked this yet--that there were four \n",
      "Cabinet positions that required confirmation in the first Congress--\n",
      "four. Then you had Ambassadors, and you had judges. But you had a \n",
      "pretty small number of nominations in those positions. Now, we have \n",
      "well over a thousand positions--well over a thousand--and we have a \n",
      "nomination process in which people are nominated to have a higher rank \n",
      "in the military or advancement to certain ranks in the civil service. \n",
      "And so you have extensive lists that need to go through as well.\n",
      "  So let&#x27;s take a look at what happened with the growth of cloture \n",
      "motions. This is the history going back to 1910. We actually only had \n",
      "cloture starting in 1917. And, in 1917, you see that there were very \n",
      "few cloture motions in a decade--3 in a decade, 10 in a decade, 5 in a \n",
      "decade, 8 in a decade, 3 in a decade--less than 1 per year.\n",
      "  Well, that intervening day kind of made sense because they were less \n",
      "than one time per year. It was supposed to be a rare moment in which \n",
      "you would address the fact that some Senators were not going to let the \n",
      "Senate proceed as our Founders envisioned, which was, after hearing \n",
      "everybody, to conduct a vote.\n",
      "  Then you start to see in the 1970s a big change. I think we have a \n",
      "chart that shows it year by year. We don&#x27;t. Well, this will give you \n",
      "some sense of it. So we have--divided by 10, since these are by \n",
      "decade--we had growth in the 1980s to more than 20 per year; a growth \n",
      "in the 1990s to more than--well, an average of 35 to 36 a year. In the \n",
      "2000s, an average of 45 per year. In the 2010 decade, an average of \n",
      "over 100 per year, taking up an entire week of the Senate&#x27;s time.\n",
      "  So how did this unfold? Well, let&#x27;s think a little bit about the fact \n",
      "that that filibuster that occurred in 1891 was about blocking Black \n",
      "Americans from having power--the power to vote--because if you have the \n",
      "power to vote, you have the power to weigh in. That means you have a \n",
      "lot of power in our society. So there was a deep determination to keep \n",
      "Black Americans from voting.\n",
      "  That was the filibuster of 1891. And its failure in the Senate--\n",
      "remember, it passed by a majority in the House, and it had majority \n",
      "support in the Senate, but the filibuster was used to crush this.\n",
      "  Now, that process meant that, from 1891 through 1965, when we passed \n",
      "voting rights in this Chamber, the filibuster was used for one thing: \n",
      "crushing the political rights of Black Americans.\n",
      "  Now, someone will say: Well, that is not quite right. There was an \n",
      "episode in 1917 in which the issue wasn&#x27;t civil rights or voting \n",
      "rights. The issue was whether to arm our commercial ships against \n",
      "potential attacks by the Germans.\n",
      "  And that is partly true.\n",
      "  In March of that year, 1917, we weren&#x27;t yet in the war, World War I. \n",
      "And there was a group of Senators who said: If we arm these ships and \n",
      "they deployed depth charges against German submarines or so forth, we \n",
      "are going to be in the war, and we will not have had a declaration of \n",
      "war. We will be pulled into the war by essentially this process of \n",
      "arming ships.\n",
      "  So they spoke at length during the last week of Congress, and time \n",
      "ran out, and the bill died. And the next week, the new Congress \n",
      "started. This is back when the transition happened in March. And the \n",
      "new Congress immediately said: We can close debate with 67 votes or \n",
      "two-thirds of the Senate. Actually, it was two-thirds; we didn&#x27;t have \n",
      "100 Senators here--two-thirds of the Senate, showing up to vote and \n",
      "close debate. So that was the first time that we had a motion to close \n",
      "debate since 1805.\n",
      "  And the reason I say it is since 1805, is that our original rules had \n",
      "a motion called the previous question. And on the previous question, \n",
      "there is a little bit of uncertainty of exactly how it was used. It \n",
      "sometimes said that, basically, you got to speed things up so we can \n",
      "get to the final vote. Other times, it has been interpreted as ``No, \n",
      "the previous question means we vote; we vote on the question before \n",
      "us.&#x27;&#x27; But it was never actually used, and it wasn&#x27;t used because there \n",
      "was a social contract.\n",
      "  The Senate said: We can listen to everybody, and, then, having heard \n",
      "everybody, we can vote.\n",
      "  Fair enough. Fair deal. Square deal.\n",
      "  So in 1805, when Aaron Burr was in charge of rewriting the rule book, \n",
      "he said: We don&#x27;t use this rule. We don&#x27;t need this rule. We have a \n",
      "social contract. We listen to everybody and then have a simple majority \n",
      "vote, as our Founders designed the Senate. No need.\n",
